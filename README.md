# Ruby-Fishes
Ruby-Fishes is a little game consists of 2 parts

1st part is dialog system were you can buy different types of tanks, fishes and
fishfood

2nd part is interactive fishfeeding, you have to feed each fish at least 1 time
to keep them alive, but remember fishes are greedy so they will eat all food you
