# Ruby-Fishes
Ruby-Fishes is a little game consists of 2 parts

1st part is dialog system were you can buy different types of tanks, fishes and
fishfood

2nd part is interactive fishfeeding, you have to feed each fish at least 1 time
to keep them alive, but remember fishes are greedy so they will eat all food you
will offer to them (with no benefit for you). So you have to be careful.

Controls:

you enter will be the answer to all questions you asked (exept name)
```

c - continue
r - restart with another tank and another fish number
